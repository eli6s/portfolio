I mainly dabble with <Accented text="Python, SQL, C, x86_64 ASM, Go"></Accented> `(desc. order)`, and I eventually plan on adding <Accented text="C++ & Rust"></Accented> to my stack.

### My interests

- general, automation, & cybersec tools

Aside from programming, I enjoy playing video games, cooking and DIY projects with small electronics.
